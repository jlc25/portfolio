    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>This project was assigned as a final group assignment for our Introduction to Data Science class. We had around
      the span of a
      month to complete our research and our report.</p>

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Our project had multiple phases, including data collection, data annotation, data analysis, and interpretation.
      much needed research.

      <dd>To start off, we got familiar with what kind of political figures would be interesting to cover. Since the
        American elections were at its peak back in Fall 2024,
        we decided to base our project on the media coverage on Trump in the elections. The scope of our project only
        touches base on the coverage of Trump in major North American News Outlets.
        Moreover, further research was done to determine which media companies would be credible and relevant at the
        same time. We had multiple discussions about bias.</dd><br>
